# Geiger Counter N1
**Based on AVR ATmega328 & Geiger-Muller tube M4011**

License under GNU General Public License v3.0

This is a project which I spent about a week or so just for preparing for it.
I used a common-found geiger tube M4011(which you can buy it cheap from China)

The whole device doesn't contain something very technical.

If you learned some stuff about the Geiger-Muller tube itself,
you will see how we can calculate them, in the form of CPM, then use the data
from the original datasheets, we can then calculate in the unit of uSv/h.
